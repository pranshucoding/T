<div style="background:yellow"><h1>Riddle: It was during the autumn season of last year when Ruth began seeing a psychiatrist due to "hallucinations" she said she was experiencing. Ruth had lived her entire life in the city but had moved far out into a very rural suburb near a forest, and close to a small pond. She reported to her psychiatrist she imagined seeing a large letter "V" in the sky one day while walking outside, as well as hearing numerous high-pitched voices she felt were trying to communicate with her. After that day, nearly every time she took a stroll outside, she would see the letter "V" up in the air, accompanied by the voices. Sometimes she reported sighting up to five of these "V" letters with the distant voices calling to her, during her daily outside walks. The psychiatrist thought for a moment, and then told Ruth she wasn't experiencing any hallucinations, but rather, was seeing ....? What did the psychiatrist suggest Ruth had been observing?<br><br>
    Answer: Having spent her whole life in the city, Ruth was not familiar with seeing flocks of geese (traveling in a "V" shape) heading south for the winter during the autumn season.</h1></div>

<div style="background:silver"><h1>Riddle: A bizarre ritual occurs, often when the weather is hot, and it has been happening for over 100 years. Two men bring two cups to a place where a large plate is located. They do not drink anything from their cups and eat nothing from the plate. Soon, a third man joins the other two, and he brings with him his cup and a wooden object. Strangely, two of the three men wear masks, despite the fact all three of them know each other. Over the next two to three hours, only one of the men remains near the large plate, while various other men continue to take their cups and wooden objects to and from their meeting place with the other two men. Just what is this strange ritual?<br><br>
Answer: The two masked men are the home plate umpire and the two catchers taking turns coming to the plate. One at a time, the hitters from both sides come to the plate to hit. All the players and the umpire always wear protective cups.</h1></div>

<div style="background:goldenrod"><h1>Riddle: Hey baseball fans, here’s an unusual game. See if you can figure out how this combination of events happened. A regular nine-inning baseball game ended with a score of two to nothing. During the game, there was one home run, a double, and 10 singles. During all these three events there was only one out. There were two walks. There were no double or triple plays. At the end of each team’s at-bat, there was no man left on base. There were no stolen bases, or pickoffs, and nobody was caught stealing. There were no errors of any type. How could this be?<br><br>
